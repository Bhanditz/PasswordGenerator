# PasswordGenerator
This program generates a number of random passwords using predefined characters, and then outputs the passwords to a text file.

## Warning
Once the passwords are generated, they are stored as **plain text** within the program directory.
Obviously, this is a security concern. The file should be deleted after the passwords are written down.
Make sure to delete the password file from your recycle bin, too.
